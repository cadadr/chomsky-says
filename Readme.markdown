# Chomksy says...

These are some silly AI toys that take in a corpus and spit out some
(in)coherent text.  I'm feeding them text from Chomsky's work which
I extracted from PDFs I have using `pdf2txt.py` from `pdfminer.six`:

    $ pdf2txt.py -o choms.txt ~/Library/chomsky*.pdf

But they should be capable of working with any textual corpus.
